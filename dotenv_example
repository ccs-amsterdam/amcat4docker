# This file is an example .env file for configuring AmCAT4 installed via the docker
# Copy this file to .env and edit the values below as needed

# # General settings
# Set to 'latest' to get the last available build
AMCAT_VERSION=4.1.0

# # Web server settings
# What is the hostname for this machine?
# Be sure to include https:// for servers that can be reached from outside
# For local testing, using http://localhost
SITE_ADDRESS=http://localhost

# # Elastic settings

# ## Data storage
# By default, data is stored on an internal docker volume
# For production, you should probably create a folder on the server,
# making sure to have uid 1000 own the folder. For example:
# sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/elastic-amcat4
# sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/lib/elastic-amcat4
# Next, fill in the folder on the next line and uncomment it:
# ELASTIC_DATA_STORAGE=/var/lib/elastic-amcat4

# ## Local accessibility
# If you want elastic to be reachable directly from the server, uncomment the next line
# ELASTIC_PUBLISHED_PORT=9200:

# ## Memory
# How much 'heap' memory can elastic use?
# In general, set this to at most 32g, and to at most half your availabile RAM (whichever is lower)
ELASTIC_MEMORY=4g

# ## Important note for elastic performance
# Elastic requires a relatively high vm.max_map_count setting to work properly
# Especially on older servers, you might need to adjust this manually
# To check, use `sysctl vm.max_map_count` - it should be 262144
# If it's lower, run this command to change it:
#   echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
# Then, either restart or run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` to update it

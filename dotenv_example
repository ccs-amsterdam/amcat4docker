# What is the hostname for this machine?
# Be sure to include https:// for servers that can be reached from outside
# For local testing, using http://localhost
SITE_ADDRESS=http://localhost

### Elastic settings ###
# ** Memory **
# How much 'heap' memory can elastic use?
# In general, set this to at most 32g, and to at most half your availabile RAM (whichever is lower)
ELASTIC_MEMORY=512m

# ** Important note for elastic performance **
# Elastic requires a relatively high vm.max_map_count setting to work properly
# Especially on older servers, you might need to adjust this manually
# To check, use `sysctl vm.max_map_count` - it should be 262144
# If it's lower, run this command to change it:
#   echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
# Then, either restart or run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` to update it
